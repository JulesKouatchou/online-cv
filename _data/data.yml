    tagline: |
      Partcipated in the design and implementation of a Python framework that 
      facilitates the integration of various Earth System model for 
      regression testing.

  - title: Python application for tracking the movement of the International Space Station (ISS)
    link: "https://github.com/astg606/pycon/tree/main/year2025/poster"
    tagline: |
      The tool performs several web scraping tasks to gather future position of ISS, 
      identify orbits and countries overpassed, gather weather forecast data along orbits, 
      perform data analytics and create statics and interactive vizualizations.

  - title: Implementation of a Parallel I/O Tool in the Land Information System (LIS)
    link: "https://github.com/JulesKouatchou/LIS_PFIO"
    tagline: |
      We implemented a parallel I/O framework (PFIO) in LIS. 
      With PFIO, the available nodes (in a multi-core platform) 
      are split into compute nodes and I/O server nodes so that the output procedures 
      can be done asynchronously. 
      The new addition allows to run the LIS model at finer resolutions, 
      significantly reduces the output time, the memory requirement, 
      and the computing resources.

  - title: Incorporate ESMF regridding capability in the Land Information System (LIS)    
    link: "https://github.com/JulesKouatchou/LIS_esmf_regrid"
    tagline: |
      We added Fortran code components to allow the model to use ESMF capabilities 
      to perform on the fly regridding.

  - title: "Data-driven Hydrological Models Using Gaussian Processes"
    tagline: |
      We added a ML model to the time-step integration of land surface models 
      in NASA Land Information Systems (LIS). 
      We used Gaussian Processes (GPs) to contruct a data-driven model. 
      The model is trained using data from observation sites with a 
      two-year split-record time period for calibration and validation.
